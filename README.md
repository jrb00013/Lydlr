# Lydlr AI â€” Multimodal Sensor Data Compression with Adaptive Real-Time Optimization

## Overview

Lydlr AI is an advanced ROS 2 system designed for real-time intelligent compression of multimodal sensor data, including camera images, LiDAR, IMU, and audio streams, specifically tailored for edge devices such as Raspberry Pi and NVIDIA Jetson.

This system leverages state-of-the-art neural network architectures combining convolutional encoders, temporal LSTM modeling, and reinforcement learning to dynamically adapt compression quality based on system resources and perceptual feedback. It integrates real-time quality assessment via the LPIPS metric to maintain high fidelity while optimizing bandwidth and storage.
